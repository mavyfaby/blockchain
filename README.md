# Blockchain

This is a personal project where I create a blockchain in Go from scratch.
The project is designed to help me understand the basic concepts of blockchain technology and how it works.

You asked, "Why I choose Go programming language?", 
I chose Go because it is a statically typed, compiled language that is designed for simplicity and efficiency.
It has built-in support for concurrency, which makes it a good choice for building distributed systems like blockchain.
It's also a learning language for me, as I am currently learning Go and I want to improve my skills in it for professional purposes.

## Project description

The project is a blockchain application that implements a cryptocurrency.
The goal is to create a decentralized system that allows users to send and receive transactions
without the need for a central authority.

## Project Proposal

You can find the project proposal in the [proposal.md](proposal.md) file.
