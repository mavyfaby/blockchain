# The Project Proposal

This document outlines the proposal for my blockchain project,
which is a personal endeavor to create a blockchain from scratch using the Go programming language.
The project aims to deepen my understanding of blockchain technology and its underlying principles while also
serving as a practical application of my learning in Go.

## Project Overview

The project composes as follows:

1. The Blockchain itself:
    - A data structure that stores a series of blocks, each containing a list of transactions.
    - Each block is linked to the previous block, forming a chain.
    - The blockchain is decentralized, meaning that it is not controlled by a single entity.
    - It is distributed across a network of nodes, each of which has a copy of the entire blockchain.
    - The blockchain is secured using cryptographic techniques, ensuring that the data stored in it is tamper-proof and immutable.
    - Must be *transparent*, allowing anyone to view the transactions stored in it.
    - Must be *scalable*, allowing it to handle a large number of transactions.
    - Must be *efficient*, allowing it to process transactions quickly and with minimal resources.
    - Must be *flexible*, allowing it to be used for a variety of applications beyond cryptocurrency.
    - Must be *extensible*, allowing it to be easily modified and improved over time.
    - Must be *secure*, ensuring that the data stored in it is protected from unauthorized access and tampering.
    - Must be *reliable*, ensuring that it is always available and aprccessible to users.

2. Smart Contracts
    - A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.
    - It allows for the automation of processes and transactions on the blockchain.
    - It is designed to be secure, ensuring that the contract cannot be tampered with once it is deployed.
    - It is designed to be efficient, allowing for quick execution of transactions without the need for intermediaries.
    - It is designed to be flexible, allowing for a wide range of applications and use cases.
    - It is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new features and functionality over time.
   
3. A custom cryptocurrency
    - A digital currency that is built on top of the blockchain.
    - It allows users to send and receive transactions without the need for a central authority.
    - It is designed to be secure, efficient, and easy to use.

4. A wallet
    - A software application that allows users to store, send, and receive the custom cryptocurrency.
    - It provides a user-friendly interface for managing the user's balance and transactions.
    - It is designed to be secure, ensuring that the user's private keys are protected from unauthorized access.
    - It is designed to be easy to use, allowing users to quickly and easily send and receive transactions.
    - It is designed to be flexible, allowing users to customize their wallet experience.
    - It is designed to be extensible, allowing users to add new features and functionality over time.

5. The REST API services
    - A web service that allows users to interact with the blockchain and the custom cryptocurrency.
    - It provides a set of endpoints for sending and receiving transactions, checking balances, and querying the blockchain.
    - It is designed to be secure, ensuring that only authorized users can access the API.
    - It is designed to be efficient, allowing it to handle a large number of requests.
    - It is designed to be flexible, allowing it to be used for a variety of applications.
    - It is designed to be extensible, allowing it to be easily modified and improved over time.
    - It is designed to be reliable, ensuring that it is always available and accessible to users.
    - It is designed to be scalable, allowing it to handle a large number of requests.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project shall be:

1. To create a working implementation of a blockchain and cryptocurrency using Go.
2. To gain a deeper understanding of blockchain technology and its underlying principles.
3. To create a user-friendly wallet application for managing the custom cryptocurrency.
4. To improve my skills in Go programming language.

## Future Works

The project is designed to be extensible and flexible, allowing for future enhancements and improvements. 
Some potential future works include:

1. Implementing additional features and functionality for the wallet application.
2. Adding support for additional cryptocurrencies and tokens.
3. Implementing a decentralized exchange for trading cryptocurrencies.
